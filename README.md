# House Price Predictor üè°
## Predicting House Prices in Ames, Iowa

This project goes through a dataset containing variables/predictors describing features of houses in Ames, Iowa. My team and I evaluated several machine learning optimization models to not only find the best prediction model with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) score but also to provide insight into which predictors seem to affect pricing the most. 

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Key highlights of the project:
- Pre-processing the data to reduce data dimentionality and convert it to a more suitable form to build models upon
- Imputing missing values of variables by comparing different imputation methods (Univariate Imputation using Mean vs Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations)
- Visualizing the data to form an initial hypothesis on what features of the house we think affect price the most
- Feature engineering (PCA and Forward Selection) to pick the most impactful predictors
- Creating a baseline model to compare performance of tuned machine learning models to
- Training tuned KNN, pruned decision trees, random forests, and tuned lasso models to pick the best prediction model while looking out for bias-variance trade-offs
